FAQ
---

**Why is this module not in [Smile's canonical repository for OpenERP contibutions](http://code.launchpad.net/smile-openerp) ?**

This code started its life in Smile's internal Subversion repository and was [migrated to Git](http://kevin.deldycke.com/2011/08/how-open-source-an-internal-corporate-project-webping/) to not loose its commit history, which would have been the case if the project was to be pushed to Bazaar.


TODO
----

  * Merge the `cell_value_range` and `increment_values` parameters.
  * Fix transparent jQuery highlight to let it end to the good color value (and not the default white).
  * Do not restrict boolean widget lines to the bottom part of the widget: treat them as normal lines and allow them to be added/removed and changed in the body of the matrix.
  * Fix matrix style when in tab (notebook).
  * Add example data in the smile_matrix_demo module to let users reproduce the screenshots easily.
  * Clean-up all this messy code and architecture.
